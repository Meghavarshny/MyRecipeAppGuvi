 MyRecipeApp

This is a simple recipe web app I made using ReactJS and TailwindCSS. It helps users search for recipes, view details, and even save their favorites. The recipe data comes from TheMealDB API.

🔍 Features

- *Recipe List*: See multiple recipes with names, images, and categories.
- *Search & Filter*: Search by name or use filters like category, ingredient, etc.
- *Recipe Details*: Includes ingredients, steps, category, and even YouTube video if available.
- *Favorites (Optional)*: You can save recipes you like. They’ll stay saved using localStorage.
